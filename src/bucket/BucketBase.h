/**
 * Bucket is an immutable container for a sorted set of "Entries" (object ID,
 * hash, xdr-message tuples) which is designed to be held in a shared_ptr<>
 * which is referenced between threads, to minimize copying. It is therefore
 * imperative that it be _really_ immutable, not just faking it.
 *
 * Two buckets can be merged together efficiently (in a single pass): elements
 * from the newer bucket overwrite elements from the older bucket, the rest are
 * merged in sorted order, and all elements are hashed while being added.
 *
 * Different types of BucketList vary on the type of entries they contain and by
 * extension the merge logic of those entries. Additionally, some types of
 * BucketList may have special operations only relevant to that specific type.
 * This pure virtual base class provides the core functionality of a BucketList
 * container and must be extened for each specific BucketList type. In
 * particular, the fresh and merge functions must be defined for the specific
 * type, while other functionality can be shared.
